# GBIF_match_waterbody
R code for downloading data from GBIF and matching to waterbody

Issue to be resolved: Information on waterbody is crucial when doing analyses on aquatic species (e.g. lake area, catchment land cover characteristics). However, the vast majority of species occurrences published are only georefference with coordinates of a point. This repro contains a selection of code-snipps to a) download occurrence data from GBIF, and b) match those to lake polygons. Fennoscandia used as example.
